Description:

	Instances divided in classes, represented as gaussians, that move within the 2-dimensional space, overlapping in some places.

	Generated with package streamMOA in R, by calling function DSD_RandomRBFGeneratorEvents with parameters k = 8, d = 2, eventMergeSplitOption = FALSE, eventDeleteCreate = FALSE, noiseInCluster = FALSE, kernelRadius = 0.03, noiseLevel = 0, kernelRadiusRange = 0.05, densityRange = 1, numClusterRange = 8, eventFrequency = 1000, speed = 5000, modelSeed = 5, instanceSeed = 7)
